A small puzzle contest I've created for 
[Vintage Computer Festival Pacific Northwest](http://vcfed.org/wp/festivals/vintage-computer-festival-pacific-northwest/). 
The first three puzzles were handed out to each visitor together with other festival materials, 
and visitors who solved all puzzles got small souvenirs.
